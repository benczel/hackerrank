Consider P1(a,c)  and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d)  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.
Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1  and P2  and format your answer to display 4  decimal digits.


The STATION table is described as follows: 

Field	Type
ID	NUMBER
CITY 	VARCHAR(21)
STATE	VARCHAR(2)
LAT_N 	NUMBER
LONG_W	NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Output Format
Your results must be in the form:
lat lon
where  is the sum of all values in LAT_N and  is the sum of all values in LONG_W. Both results must be rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
