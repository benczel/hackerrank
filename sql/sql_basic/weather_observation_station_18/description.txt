Desription: 
Consider P1(a,b)  and P2(c,d)  to be two points on a 2D plane.
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.


The STATION table is described as follows: 

Field	Type
ID	NUMBER
CITY 	VARCHAR(21)
STATE	VARCHAR(2)
LAT_N 	NUMBER
LONG_W	NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Output Format
Your results must be in the form:
lat lon
where  is the sum of all values in LAT_N and  is the sum of all values in LONG_W. Both results must be rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
